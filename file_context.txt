I am lfrfilms with L and not with I, unfortunately twitch font doesn't allow to understand if it's a "i" or a "l" so twitchers used to call me IFR, very hard to pronounce.
LFR comes as a minimalistic new nickname of "La Foret Des Renards", this name was born in 2014 when I wanted to give a personal nickname to my own film production company. The idea came from the two things I loved the most: Forests and Foxes. The french touch is just because it makes everything look more beautiful. Throughout the years I started struggling with giving my full nickname to important clients, so I turned into LFR. My discord channel is https://discord.gg/Ua88uXWCmB. I love to keep one only for collecting all my friends I'm meeting through my journey.
I have a dog called Leyla, she is a street dog from Romania, she can speak with me, through a deep connection. I'm currently living in Berlin but I want to move to Bangkok, any lead is appreciated.
